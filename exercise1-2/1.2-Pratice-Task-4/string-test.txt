CODE PRACTICE 4: STRINGS

Assume that you’ve run the following statements:

>>> str1 = 'hello, '
>>> str2 = 'how are you?'
>>> str3 = str1 + str2
To practice what you’ve learned, without using Python’s shell, work out on 
your own what the following statements would return:

str3[3:]
str3[-3:]
str3[2:9:3]
str3[::-2]
str3[2:8]

1. Make a note of your answers in a text document.
2. Create a sub folder inside your “Exercise 1.2” folder and name it 
“1.2-Practice Task 4” or something similar. Upload your text document or a 
screenshot of your answers in this folder.

Answers: 

str3[3:] >>> "lo, how are you?" 

str3[-3:] >>> "ou?"

str3[2:9:3] >>> "l,o"

str3[::-2] >>> "?o r o olh"

str3[2:8] >>> "llo, h"
